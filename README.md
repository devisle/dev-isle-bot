### When contributing
When contributing please ensure you follow these simple guidelines:
 - Name your branches appropriately, i.e., task/ bug/ feature/ etc. We aren't strict here, but a general idea prior is nice! :P
 - Write useful commit messages, formatted with a present tense title and a descriptive body. I.e.,
    * TITLE: Add RoleService
    * BODY: Added the role service, updates roles on points. Problem with where we're updating though...
If the DB call only makes it half way, the user will never receive a role update.
